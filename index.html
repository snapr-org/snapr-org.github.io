        <h1>Using crypto-currency to end hunger, poverty and strife</h1>
      </div>
      <p class="lead"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_income">Universal Basic Income</a> <b>will end world hunger</b>.</p>
      <p>Our planet actually produces enough resources for all of us to thrive. The problem is that some of us <b>waste</b> and some of us <b>consume</b> more than our share.</p>
      <p>We believe that the most compelling use case for blockchain technologies is to provide every human being with a basic income. We are working on a cryptocurrency that will give <b>one coin</b> to <b>every</b> living <b>human being</b>, <b>every day</b>.</p>
      <p>We hope that the effect of giving everyone a basic income will be that every human being will have enough food, clothing and shelter to thrive. We strive to create a world where survival is not a challenge and where our collective human resources are freed up to work on the most pressing challenges faced by our planet instead of focussing on our mundane survival requirements.</p>
      <p>We are <i>economists</i>, <i>humanitarians</i>, <i>translators</i>, <i>programmers</i>, <i>thinkers</i>, <i>environmentalists</i>, <i>capitalists</i>, <i>socialists</i> and <i>parents</i> who want to leave the world to our children in a better state than we found it.</p>
      <p>Our mission is huge. Our impact is even bigger. We probably need your help. If you would like to contribute, email <a href="mailto:info@snapr.org">info@snapr.org</a> and share your thoughts with us.</p>
      <p>Here are some ways you might help:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Think and share your thoughts. We are attempting to solve an extremely complex problem. We are a think-tank foremost and an implementation strategist secondarily.
          <ul>
            <li>How do we deal with inflation in a global currency where potentially 7.6 billion coins are minted daily?</li>
            <li>How do we safely allocate money to children and vulnerable individuals?</li>
            <li>How do we deal with regulation on a global scale?</li>
            <li>How do we deal with identity on a global scale?</li>
            <li>How do we deal with crime prevention?</li>
            <li>How do we prevent corruption and financial misappropriation?</li>
            <li>Should we leverage blockchain to implement taxation at the transaction level or should we leave that problem to national revenue organisations?</li>
            <li>Should we leverage blockchain to reward distributed, decentralised transaction processors with a transaction fee or should we centralise transaction processing under a governance trust?</li>
            <li>What other questions should we be asking or thinking about?</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Write content and documentation that describes our mission, implementation and challenges. Our documentation is also a roadmap for our implementation so it is vital to the success of our mission.</li>
        <li>Translate content and documentation into a language you are proficient in.</li>
        <li>
          Write open-source software for our implementations.
          <ul>
            <li>Develop websites that describe and support our mission.</li>
            <li>Develop smartphone applications for end users to view, spend and access their basic income.</li>
            <li>Develop highly secure and highly scalable back-end software capable of unprecedented levels of blockchain transaction frequency.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Test our software.</li>
      </ul>
